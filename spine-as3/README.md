# `spine-as3`

The spine-as3 runtime provides basic functionality to load and manipulate [Spine](http://esotericsoftware.com) skeletal animation data using Adobe's ActionScript 3.0 (AS3). The [`spine.flash` package](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes/tree/master/spine-as3/spine-as3/src/spine/flash) can be used to render Spine animations using Flash, or spine-as3 can be extended to enable Spine animations for other AS3 projects, such as [Starling](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes/tree/master/spine-starling).

## Setup

1. Download the Spine Runtimes source using [git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) or by downloading it [as a zip](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes/archive/master.zip).
1. Project files are provided for Adobe Flash Builder 4.6. You will need to create a new project and import the source for other IDEs.

Alternatively, the contents of the `spine-as3/src` directory can be copied into your project.
