The spine-cocos2dx runtime provides basic functionality to load and manipulate [Spine](http://esotericsoftware.com) skeletal animation data using [cocos2d-x](http://www.cocos2d-x.org/). spine-cocos2dx is based on [spine-c](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes/tree/master/spine-c).

## Setup

1. Download the Spine Runtimes source using [git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) or by downloading it [as a zip](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes/archive/master.zip).
1. Place the `cocos2d`, `CocosDenshion`, and `kazmath` directories from a cocos2d-iphone (v2.1-rc1 or later) distribution into the `spine-cocos2d-iphone/libs` directory.
